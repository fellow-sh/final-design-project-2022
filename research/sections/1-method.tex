\section*{Method}

Our experiment for determining the ideal mixture involves 5 sample mixtures and one control mixture (which will just be salt).
The sample mixtures will have the following volumetric ratio of hemp to salt: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1.
The sample mixtures will contain a third of the salt of the control mixture.

Due to constraints in equipment, the effectiveness of each mixture will be measured by the thickness of ice that it melts.
The ice will be grown in small food storage containers in overnight winter conditions.
Once the water inside the containers is fully frozen, each mixture will be applied to the exposed ice surface. After 90 minutes, amount of ice melted will be observed.

With consideration for the size of the containers, control sample will have \SI{30}{\ml} of salt.
Thus, each experimental sample will have \SI{10}{\ml} of salt and their respective amount of hemp hurd.
