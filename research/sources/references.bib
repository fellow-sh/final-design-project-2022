  abstract     = {Applying prewet deicers to roads during adverse winter weather is a cost-effective strategy to improve transportation safety and mobility. Prewet deicers have a small amount of liquid product applied to solid salt or salt/sand that speeds up ice melting and reduces deicer bounce-and-scatter loss. This study first presents the results of an in-depth survey of the Pacific Northwest on prewetting practices and then presents laboratory tests that quantified the ice melting, frictional behavior, and variation in snow–pavement bond strength of salt prewetted with various liquid deicers and at various rates. An ice melting test is a broadly accepted method to gauge the basic performance of deicers in a laboratory. More sophisticated laboratory tests on asphalt pavement samples with realistic snow and representative trafficking motion and forces were conducted. The laboratory tests confirmed that the prewetting liquid-to-solid application rate in the range of 33–67 L/t (8–16 gal./t) is reasonable for increasing the speed and total ice melting capacity (IMC) of solid salt. Furthermore, prewetting significantly reduced snow–pavement bond strength but did not increase friction more than dry salt.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The use of deicing agents during the winter months is one of many stressors that impact stream ecosystems in urban and urbanizing watersheds. In this study, a long-term data set collected by citizen scientists with the Missouri Stream Team was used to evaluate the relationships between watershed urbanization metrics and chloride metrics. Further, these data were used to explore the effects of elevated chloride concentrations on stream invertebrate communities using quantile regression. While the amount of road surface in a watershed was a dominant factor in predicting the maximum chloride measurement, the median chloride concentration was also strongly related to the amount of medium-to-high density development in the watershed, suggesting that nonmunicipal salt use is an important contributor to increases in base flow chloride concentrations. Additionally, chloride concentration appears to be one of the many factors that impact invertebrate density and diversity measurements, with decreases in invertebrate diversity corresponding with the US Environmental Protection Agency water quality criteria. Our findings suggest that the use of chloride-based road salt on municipal roads as well as on nonmunicipal settings is contributing to a loss of diversity and density of aquatic invertebrate communities in urban regions.
